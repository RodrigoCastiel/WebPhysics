{"name":"Webphysics","tagline":"Physics playground - just for fun! ","body":"## Introduction\r\n_Webphysics_ is what I've done during a winter week in Minnesota. It features a basic 2d-physics simulation for particles, springs, dampers, elastic ropes and meshes. There are 6 main modes (5 of which were implemented) that allow to add particles, connectors, elastic ropes and meshes. The gravity is computed by a summation of gravitational fields (code-specified by functions) and also can be enabled/disabled. It is possible to connect particles to springs, ropes, dampers and manually create complex systems and attach them to the wall. Moreover, in edit mode we can interact with objects using mouse click and drag, which changes their position and velocity. Example: try to generate waves in strings! To make edition easy, simulation pause is available.\r\n\r\n## Modes description\r\nModes are selectable by numerical keys from 1 to 6 on the keyboard.\r\n### 1. Edit Mode\r\nInfo:  Uses the mouse input to change position and velocity for particles, elastic ropes and meshes.\r\nGuide: left-click on an object, drag holding the button and release.\r\nFuture features: change object attributes (mass, density, color, elasticity coefficient and so on) and delete it.\r\n### 2. Area Edit\r\nInfo:  not implemented yet.\r\nGuide: not implemented yet.\r\nFuture features: select all objects within a rectangle area and set all their attributes simultaneously or even delete them.\r\n### 3. Add Particle\r\nInfo: Creates a particle to the physical system with origin coordinates at the mouse left-click position and a velocity proportional to mouse displacement.\r\nGuide: left-click anywhere, drag holding the button to specify initial speed orientation and release.\r\n\r\n### 4. Add Connector\r\nInfo: Adds connector from a particle to either a fixed point or another particle. By pressing C on keyboard the user changes the type of connector: rope, spring or damper (each one with a different color and shape).\r\nGuide: TODO(RodrigoCastiel)\r\n\r\n### 5. Mesh 1d\r\nInfo: Adds a string made up by particles and elastic ideal ropes. Left button creates a string with free ends and right button creates a string with the two ends attached to the background.\r\nGuide: TODO(RodrigoCastiel)\r\n\r\n### 6. Mesh 2d\r\nInfo: Adds a 2d-mesh structure made up by particles, springs and dampers. It is still under development.\r\nGuide: TODO(RodrigoCastiel)\r\n\r\n## Extra features\r\n* Press space bar for toggle pause/run\r\n* Press G to enable/disable gravity\r\n* Leave the mouse cursor on a particle and press +/- to change the its radius\r\n* Gravity field lines are drawn\r\n* A menu helps the user to play with the simulator\r\n\r\nAll particles' attributes are settable through the source code. In the future, edit mode will be in charge of it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
